;;;; == Notes ==============================================
;;;; Board pieces are defined in the checkers.css file.  The
;;;; currently defined pieces are:
;;;;     :red-piece
;;;;     :black-piece
;;;;     :prom-red-piece
;;;;     :prom-black-piece
;;;;     :empty
;;;;
;;;; The board is laid out as a 32 element map, one element
;;;; for each position.  It is stored in an atom, and bound
;;;; to the UI.  Any update of the atom will cause an UI
;;;; refresh to reflect the current board state.
;;;;
;;;; core.async is used to implement CSP (Communicating
;;;; Sequential Proceses), and channels are used to report
;;;; user interaction events, as well as changing the board
;;;; state.

;;; == Schema ==========================================

;;; == Globals =========================================

;;; Well, they aren't quite that evil. But they're worth
;;; calling out

                       ;; move next?
                       :pending-move nil}))

; ===Channels ===========================================
; the board generates events on this channel
;     {:event :event-symbol
;      :position <int>}

;     (atom (create-board))
;; TODO: Set up a go loop to feed that to anyone
;; who asks.
;; It makes a lot more sense than the top level atom that
;; I'm using now.
;; Then again, that's actually a fairly tricky proposition.
;; Well, I could always just loop and put the atom on the
;; channel, but that almost seems pointless.
;; Actually, this seems to be the key to this particular
;; design. Have a go-loop in the UI namespace pulling from
;; this channel. Anything that updates state here should
;; sling those updates here instead of just updating the
;; atoms.
;; Or maybe that's just over-complicating things. Maybe
;; this is just a red herring.

;; Memoize neighbors for every board position
;; If this were a really slow process, we'd have some

;; 1. Is this something that's worth delaying the page
;; load to get the cache built?
;; 2. Is it OK to delay any individual interaction
;; to cache a result we haven't already computed?
;; 3. Is the default memoization approach viable?
;; For 32 board positions, we aren't talking about a
;; lot of space.
;; If we had 2^32 or 2^64 spots to cache...we'd probably
;; never want to cache them all.
;; OTOH...for this particular scenario, the "real" solution
;; seems to be using a macro to generate a map at compile
;; time.
;; Real-world considerations are tricky and specific to
;; the actual problem at hand.
